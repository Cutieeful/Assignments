# GIT AND GIT HUB

A brief description of what this project is about:

This is Zuri week 5 task. We were given some things to do to help us have a better knowledge on what Git is and how it can help us store our projects effectively. Alot of resources were given to add better understanding of this task.




## Lessons Learned

I learnt how to intialize, commit and push my files to a branches I created in my repository. 

While doing these I had to watch a lot of Youtube videos and follow step by step to be sure I am on the right track.
I had issues trying to use my vscode terminal and while configuring my gitbash.

Overall, it was an interesting experience.
